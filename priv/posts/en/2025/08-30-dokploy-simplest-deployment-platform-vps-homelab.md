# Dokploy: The Simplest Deployment Platform for Your VPS or Homelab

Tired of complex CI/CD setups? Want the power of Vercel but with total control over your infrastructure? Dokploy is the answer you've been looking for.

I discovered Dokploy during a frustrating migration from Kubernetes to something simpler. After testing dozens of solutions, I found a platform that combines the simplicity of Heroku with the flexibility of Docker - and best of all: it's completely open source.

## What Is Dokploy?

Dokploy is a self-hosted deployment platform that transforms any VPS into a powerful deployment machine. Think Vercel or Netlify, but running on your own infrastructure, with full Docker support and native GitHub/GitLab integration.

### Why Choose Dokploy?

After years struggling with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and custom bash scripts, I found in Dokploy a solution that solves real problems:

- **Simplicity**: Intuitive web interface for managing deployments
- **Flexibility**: Support for any application that runs in Docker
- **Total Control**: Your infrastructure, your rules
- **Zero Lock-in**: Open source code, data on your machine
- **Economy**: No deployment costs or artificial limits

## Environment Setup: Requirements

Before we start, you'll need:

### Minimum Hardware

- **CPU**: 2 cores (4 cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 20GB free (SSD preferable)
- **Network**: Public IP with ports 80, 443 and 3000 open

### Base Software

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+ (tested and recommended)
- **Docker**: Version 20.10+
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.0+

## Step 1: Initial Server Configuration

First, let's prepare our server. If you're using a VPS on Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or any other provider:

### System Updates

```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh root@YOUR_IP_HERE

# Update the system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install essential dependencies
apt install -y curl wget git ufw
```

### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Configure UFW for basic security
ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP
ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
ufw allow 3000/tcp  # Dokploy UI
ufw --force enable
```

### Docker Installation

```bash
# Install Docker using the official script
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh

# Start and enable Docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## Step 2: Dokploy Installation

Now comes the easiest part - installing Dokploy:

```bash
# Run the official installation script
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

This script will:

1. Download the Dokploy Docker image
2. Configure docker-compose.yml
3. Start all necessary services
4. Configure nginx for reverse proxy

### Verifying Installation

```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker ps

# You should see containers like:
# - dokploy
# - dokploy-postgres
# - dokploy-redis
```

## Step 3: First Access and Configuration

### Accessing the Web Interface

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://YOUR_IP:3000
```

### Initial Setup

1. **Create Admin Account**: Set email and password for the administrative user
2. **Configure DNS**: Set up your domain (optional at this moment)
3. **SSL Certificate**: Configure Let's Encrypt for automatic HTTPS

### Domain Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

If you have a domain:

```bash
# Configure DNS A record pointing to your server
# example.com -> YOUR_IP
# *.example.com -> YOUR_IP (for automatic subdomains)
```

## Step 4: Deploying Your First Application

Let's deploy an Elixir/Phoenix application to demonstrate Dokploy's power:

### 1. Preparing the Repository

Make sure your project has:

- `Dockerfile` at root
- Environment variables configured
- Correct port binding

### 2. Creating Application in Dokploy

In the web interface:

1. **Click "New Application"**
2. **Select "GitHub Repository"**
3. **Configure the repository**:
   - URL: `https://github.com/username/project`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build Path: `.` (project root)
   - Dockerfile Path: `Dockerfile`

### 3. Environment Variables Configuration

Configure necessary variables:

```bash
# Example for Phoenix application
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_super_secure_secret_key_here
MIX_ENV=prod
PORT=4000
PHX_HOST=example.com
```

### 4. Database Configuration

Dokploy makes database creation easy:

1. **Click "New Database"**
2. **Select PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB**
3. **Configure credentials**
4. **Connect to application**

### 5. Automatic Deploy

Click **"Deploy"** and watch the magic happen:

```bash
# Real-time logs will show:
# → Cloning repository...
# → Building Docker image...
# → Starting container...
# → Health check passed ✅
# → Deployment successful!
```

## Step 5: Advanced Configuration

### Automatic SSL with Let's Encrypt

```bash
# In Dokploy panel, go to Settings > SSL
# Enable "Auto SSL" and configure:
# - Email for certificates
# - Domains to certify
```

### Automatic Backup

Configure backups for data protection:

```bash
# Create backup script
#!/bin/bash
# backup-dokploy.sh

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/dokploy"

mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup database
docker exec dokploy-postgres pg_dumpall -U postgres > $BACKUP_DIR/postgres_$DATE.sql

# Backup volumes
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/volumes_$DATE.tar.gz /var/lib/docker/volumes/

# Keep only last 7 backups
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "*.sql" -mtime +7 -delete
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Basic Monitoring

Configure basic alerts:

```bash
# Install htop for monitoring
apt install -y htop

# Configure logrotate for Docker logs
echo '/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log {
  daily
  missingok
  rotate 7
  compress
  notifempty
  create 644 root root
}' > /etc/logrotate.d/docker
```

## Practical Examples: Different Deploy Types

### Node.js/Express Deploy

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Python/FastAPI Deploy

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Static Site Deploy

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
```

## Troubleshooting: Common Issues

### Build Fails: Dockerfile Not Found

```bash
# Problem: Incorrect build context
# Solution: Check "Build Path" in Dokploy
# Should point to where Dockerfile is located
```

### Application Won't Start: Port Binding

```bash
# Problem: Application not listening on correct port
# Solution: Configure PORT variable and bind to 0.0.0.0
PORT=4000
PHX_HOST=0.0.0.0  # For Phoenix
HOST=0.0.0.0      # For other apps
```

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Problem: App can't connect to database
# Solution: Use Docker internal hostname
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@dokploy-postgres:5432/db
```

### SSL Certificate Problems

```bash
# Problem: Certificate doesn't generate
# Solution: Check DNS and firewall
dig example.com  # Should return server IP
```
